# MMM-ISS-Live

**MMM-ISS-Live** is module for [MagicMirrorÂ²](https://github.com/MagicMirrorOrg/MagicMirror) to display a live video stream from the International Space Station.

Live video from the International Space Station includes internal views when the crew is on-duty and Earth views at other times. The video is accompanied by audio of conversations between the crew and Mission Control. This video is only available when the space station is in contact with the ground.

During "loss of signal" periods, viewers will see a blue screen. Since the station orbits the Earth once every 90 minutes, it experiences a sunrise or a sunset about every 45 minutes. When the station is in darkness, external camera video may appear black, but can sometimes provide spectacular views of lightning or city lights below.

There are several video streams from the ISS on YouTube. To switch to another stream, you need to set the URL option as in the customized example above.

- _LIVE: NASA Live Stream of Earth from Space (ISS)_
  `"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xRPjKQtRXR8?si=zi-AnQaKiuwKkaLR"`
- _Live Video from the International Space Station (Official NASA Stream)_ - **Default**
  `"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OCem0E-0Q6Y?si=ABf9IB2wDLzHxgeW"`

**Side note:** _Basically you can use this module to embed any YouTube video. You only need to find out the embedded URL of the video and enter it as url option._

## Project status

Since the original module didn't work anymore and the author, [Mykle1](https://github.com/Mykle1), is no longer active, I forked the module. I fixed a few issues and will try to keep the module working in the future.

**This module is in maintenance mode.**

## Known issues

If you use pi-hole or any other ad blocker, you may need to whitelist some ad URLs to get the video stream working. Check out the browser console for the URL(s).
